# Serverless REST API with AWS

## Overview
In this project, I created a fully serverless REST API using AWS services to handle requests, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and return responses. This architecture takes advantage of AWSâ€™s serverless offerings, allowing me to build and deploy a RESTful API without managing servers. The core services used include AWS Lambda for compute, AWS DynamoDB for database operations, and AWS API Gateway for routing HTTP requests. A serverless architecture like this provides scalability, high availability, and lower operational costs, as AWS automatically manages scaling and infrastructure provisioning. The combination of these services also offers seamless integration, making it efficient to deploy, maintain, and monitor APIs.

# Step 7: Testing the API Call Using Postman

## Overview:
Postman is a popular tool for testing APIs by simulating HTTP requests to verify that they work as expected. In this step, you will test the deployed serverless REST API by making a `POST` request to the API endpoint generated by API Gateway.

## Steps:

### 1. **Navigate to `web.postman.co`**:
   - Open a web browser and go to [Postman](https://web.postman.co/).
   - Make sure you are logged into your account and have the necessary setup completed.
   - Once on the default Postman page, click the **`+`** button to open a new request tab.
   - Change the request method to **`POST`** using the dropdown menu next to the URL field.

### 2. **Fill In the Request Editor**:
   - In the URL field, paste the **Invoke URL** you copied from API Gateway after deploying the API.
   - Below the URL field, click on the **Body** tab, then select **raw**.
   - From the dropdown to the right of **raw**, choose `JSON` as the data format.
   - In the editor, input the following JSON payload (this may vary depending on your API design):

     ```
     json
     {
       "operation": "create",
       "tableName": "apigateway-lambda-crud",
       "payload": {
         "Item": {
           "ID": "gateway",
           "Number": "8201"
         }
       }
     }
     ```
   - Click the **Send** button to make the request.

### 3. **Verify API Call**:
   - After sending the request, inspect the response in the bottom panel of Postman.
   - Ensure the response status code is `200 OK` and that the response body matches the expected output from the Lambda function (e.g., confirmation of the item creation in DynamoDB).
   - If there are any errors, review the payload and URL for correctness.

## Conclusion:
Testing your API through Postman ensures that your serverless architecture is functioning as expected. By simulating real-world HTTP requests, you can verify that your Lambda functions are correctly handling DynamoDB operations, and that the API Gateway is routing requests properly. This marks the final step in validating your fully functional serverless REST API.

# Step 2: AWS Lambda IAM Role Setup

## Overview:
The AWS Lambda IAM role is very crucial because it makes sure that the lambda function has permission to access the DynamoDB table.

## Steps:
1. ** Navigate to the AWS Console**:
   - Find the `IAM` service > `Policies` > `create policy`.
2. **Fill In the JSON policy editor**:
   - Give me the limit of function, the ability to basically edit the items in the DynamoDB.
   - Watch the CloudWatch Stream (optional).
3. **Review and Create**:
   - After all the information is filled out click next.
   - enter the policy name and add a optional description.
